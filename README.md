# Favorite Movies / Series
##### *here is a list of some of the movies or series that tug some strings and warm my heart* 

- **Pride & Prejudice** 
*(written by Jane Austen and directed by Joe Wright)*
Supposed to be a romantic/comedy movie. I don't remember
which part of the movie was supposed to be funny though..

- **Whisper of the heart** 
*(written by Hayao Miyazaki and directed by Yushifumi Kondo)*
My all-time favorite ghibli movie. People think it's boring 
because of its simplicity compared to the other ghibli movies. 
But that's what makes me love this more. It's so simple. and real. 
although it has some fantasy elements, 
what the characters felt and went through as they faced 
their self-discovery, youth, and dreams were real. 

- **Kimi ni todoke**
*(written and illustrated by Karuho Shiina)*
They are so perfect. 
Sawako is someone you would want to be. 
And Kazehaya is someone you would want to have.

- **Skip to loafer**
*(written by Mikasi Takamatsu and directed by Kotomi Deai)* 
My favorite girl Mitsumi i love you 

- **Reply 1988**
*(written by Lee Woojung and directed by Shin Wonho)*
